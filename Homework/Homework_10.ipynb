    "\n",
    "a) For the same cosmology as in Problem 2 ($k=0, \\Omega_\\Lambda=1$), find the comoving radius $r_{eh}$ of galaxies that will be on our event horizon at a time $t$ in the future, i.e., galaxies with which we will be unable to communicate. In other words, light signals sent by us at time $t$ will never reach those galaxies, light signals sent out by those galaxies at time $t$ will never reach us, and therefore we will never see those galaxies as they appeared at time $t$ and thereafter. Show that, in this case, $r_{eh}$ shrinks exponentially, and we thus lose the possibility of communication with more and more of our neighbors.\n",
